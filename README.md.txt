Attempts that failed:

- FGSM
- PGD
- BIM

Then stuck in library conflict hell (eager mode, tensorflow v1/v2, etc.) trying to use Carlini-Wagner from several library:

- adversarial-robustness-toolbox
- foolbox
- deepdefend
- also attempted to convert the model to torch to use advertorch

L2 tested, probably have to go for L0
